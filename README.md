### Seat Allocation Algorithm

The system implements a merit-based allocation algorithm:

1. **Rank-based Processing**: Candidates are processed in order of their rank
2. **Preference Matching**: For each candidate, preferences are checked in order
3. **Seat Availability**: System checks if seats are available in the preferred category
4. **Allocation**: If available, seat is allocated and matrix is updated
5. **Payment Status**: Allocation is marked as pending until payment confirmation

### Database Triggers & Stored Procedures

The system uses several MySQL triggers and a stored procedure to maintain data integrity and automate seat allocation:

- **Automatic Total Calculation**: Triggers ensure total seats are always accurate
- **Over-allocation Prevention**: Built-in checks prevent allocating more seats than available
- **Payment Integration**: Automatic status updates when payments are confirmed
- **Data Consistency**: Maintains referential integrity across all related tables

*For complete SQL setup instructions, refer to the SQL documentation file in the repository.*


### Payment Simulation Note

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This system uses a simulated payment system for demonstration purposes. The payment buttons send POST requests to simulate payment processing, but no actual financial transactions occur.
